Each investigator has three health points. These health points are one of the core resources an investigator may use to solve a mystery in Donâ€™t Dream. Health points represent the bodily health of a character. Health points can be lost during the course of a mystery, usually during [Putting the Pieces Together](/putting-the-pieces-togethre) but they can be regained during [downtime](/downtime-moves).

If an investigator would lose their last health point, they are faced with a choice: narrate their death, or [sacrifice a bond](/moves-everyone-has#back-from-the-brink).

If they narrate the investigator's death, that character is either retired from play or the investigator can choose to return as one of the [Unseen](/playbooks/unseen).
