Each investigator starts with three reality points. These reality points are one of the core resources an investigator may use to solve a mystery in Don’t Dream. Reality points represent the connection a character has to the waking world & reality. Reality points are lost more frequently than Health points but they are more easily reclaimed. They are also often used to assign magical items at the conclusion of a mystery.

If an investigator would lose his last reality point, they are faced with a choice: accept the loss of the point and narrate their character’s final loss of reality, or instead [sacrifice a bond](/moves-everyone-has#back-from-the-brink).

If they narrate the character’s final loss of reality, their character is retired from play. A character losing all hold on reality cannot return as one of the Unseen.

## Fading from Reality

In the world of Don’t Dream, an investigator who loses their last reality point may become catatonic as their mind travels into some other dimension, they may die in a violent way, or they may simply leave the room and never return. If the latter happens, the town of Coffin’s Mill simply forgets they exist.

Most of the time, when an investigator loses his last reality point, any other investigators present should also make reality checks.
