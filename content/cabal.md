As the investigators uncover cabal clues, they advance the meta plot of the game and the saga of Coffin's Mill towards its inevitable end. The Keeper should update the Cabal sheet and play out any scenes or consequences associated with it each time the investigators unlock a new clue or advance a level.

## Level 1 - Reveal the Hand of the Cabal

Unlock level 1 of the Cabal when the players would obtain their first cabal clue

To be written: A short reading that essentially sets the scene in regards to the bastards in charge of the town.

The Keeper must answer the following questions:

- What is the cabal after? What is their goal?
- Who serves as the Emissary of the cabal in town?

## Level 2 - The Dark History of Coffin's Mill

The Dark History is revealed. Feel free to use these as cabal clues, or write your own dark history of Coffin's Mill.

- 1818 / Thaddeus Coffin arrives with his fortune and builds the first mills in Coffin's Mill. He sacrifices the first of many souls to the dark god Moloch, the Titan to whom he owes his many successes.
- 1825 / Coffin, now in his seventies, has become a recluse. He rarely makes public appearances,
- 1836 / A series of mill strikes lead Coffin to call in the state troopers and the national guard to spur production back into action. Things turn violent when a misplaced rock causes the national guard to open fire into the crowd. After this, Coffin retires from public life entirely, selling his mills to a Boston firm. Curiously, there are no records of his death.
- 1931 / An movie adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s novel The Turmoil being filmed in the old Coffin estate turns sour when a mass murder takes place during a party. A bit player named Blythe Jennings, apparently spurned by the lead actor William Gold, donned a cloak and glove adorned with knives and killed them all.
- 1940 / The Coffin estate is turned at great expense into a luxury hotel. It lasts one season before the winter caretaker, a writer from Maine, murders his family and burns much of the place down.
- 1944 / The Coffin estate is bulldozed and turned into a summer camp. It is continually open and shut throughout the next thirty years as strange and sometimes deadly incidents continuously occur.
- 1958 / The Coffin Toy Company (later renamed CTC Toys) is formed. Their flagship item, the Bawlin’ Billy is i mmediately popular. There are a rash of complaints when several Billy’s are opened and shown to contain strange occult symbols carved into the plastic interiors. The company denies any knowledge of how this could have happened.
- 1969/ The group of hippies known as the Church of the Sacred Cow sets up in a newly built strip mall. Radical evangelical Christians, they frequently take new recruits camping. When they take a few too many high-school aged girls camping, complaints from local parents turn into an all out assault, and the Church is driven out of town.
- 1977 / A group of teenagers playing a role-playing game cause a panic in the town when one of them, 16 year old Laura Marnoli, is immolated in a basement. The remaining three are unable to speak of the event. Two die in an insane asylum within the next 5 years. One remains alive, and when pressed, he can’t help but rave incoherently about a demon named Moloch who they summoned accidentally.

The Keeper must answer the following questions, and revise their answers to any previous questions if necessary.

- Who founded the cabal?
- Who do the cabal worship?
- What do you think happened to Thaddeus Coffin?

## Level 3 - The Nightmaster Cometh!

Unlock level 3 of the Cabal when the investigators would obtain their 5th cabal clue

The Cabal unleash the avatar of nightmares on the town in a bid to stop the investigators from reaching the truth.

The Nightmaster, the progeny of a thousand crimes and mutilations, is the vengeful ghost of a child killer killed by the Cabal of town elders and impressed into service for an eternity. The players should be digging into the history of the town and will have attracted the attention of the town elders by now.

The Nightmaster varies depending on your game, but in general they appear as they did in life - a shabby, nondescript person with a terrible temper and a sense of humor trained on the poorest quality television.

Each investigator in order of highest hold on reality to lowest narrates a dream sequence where the Nightmaster finds them.

- What is the happy memory that you find yourself in, and how is it a little bit wrong?
- What is the fear that the Nightmaster exploits?

After each investigator has narrated their dream, they roll + POWER (again, in order of highest reality to lowest).

- On a 12+, the Nightmaster is banished. No other players have to roll.
- On a 10+, you evade the Nightmaster.
- On a 7-9+, you evade the Nightmaster, but they take a toll on your body and soul. Explain how and lose 1 health or 1 reality.
- On a miss, you do not evade the Nightmaster, and your investigator is claimed by death and insanity.

In addition to this, the Keeper should now create answers to the following questions

- What happened at the Cabin in the Woods?
- What leads the investigators there?

The Keeper should also feel free to revise the answers to the questions asked in previous Cabal scenes.

## Level 4 - No More Room in Hell

Unlock level 4 of the Cabal when the investigators would have obtained their 8th cabal clue.

Things are spiraling out of hand for the Cabal. As their plans spiral out of control, the ancient powers that the Cabal have been consorting with exact their vengeance.

Vengeful ghosts of those that have died at the hands of the Cabal, during the mystery investigations, or in the investigator’s backstory will torment the investigators. The Elsewhere phase will no longer be played. Instead each investigator must narrate a scene for another where a ghost will attempt to do physical or mental harm to another. Start with the investigator with the lowest reality creating a scene for the investigator with the next lowest reality and then proceed as such until the investigator with the most reality creates a scene for the investigator with the least.

The Keeper should attempt to finalize the answers to the questions asked in previous Cabal scenes.

## Level 5 - The Cabin in the Woods

Unlock level 5 of the Cabal when the investigators would obtain their 9th cabal clue.

The secret history of Coffin's Mill comes down to a cabin in the woods. At this point, there are no more individual mysteries and all the remaining efforts of the investigators are put towards unraveling the final truths of the Cabal. Using the answers to the questions asked in the previous cabal scenes, the Keeper should direct the players to the Cabin in the Woods, where they can unlock the awful truth about the town and either save it or meet their doom.

## The Emissary & The Emissary Moves

Early on, the keeper should pick a member of the community to serve as the Cabal’s emissary. This can be anyone, from a shopkeeper to the mayor to a frequently truant child. Once the characters have unlocked their first Cabal clue, the keeper gains access to the emissary moves (see Keeper moves).
