title: All small towns are the same

When you attempt to solve a problem that you wouldnâ€™t find in a big city, roll + Affect.
On any hit, mark a clue. On a 10+, you choose one, while on a 7-9, the GM chooses one. On a 12+ you also unlock a Cabal clue.

- Who here is hiding something?
- What is the obvious clue everyone else has overlooked?
- What is the imminent danger you realize just in time?
