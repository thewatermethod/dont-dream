Once per session, if the investigators are spinning their wheels, you may narrate a scene indicating the killer has struck again. Roll + POWER.

- On a 10+, the victim narrowly escaped. Describe the first hand account with the help of the keeper. You gather a clue.
- On a 7-9+, the killer claimed another victim. You or another investigator can sacrifice a bond. If you do, you gain a clue.
