title: Patch em up
---

When you use your training to heal a fellow investigator, Roll + BODY.

- On a 10+, you mark a bond point and they restore a health point.
- On a 7-9, they restore a health point. Explain how your bedside manner is somewhat lacking.

You may use "Patch em up" as a downtime action. If you do so, there's no need to roll. Each investigator besides yourself gains 1 HP.
