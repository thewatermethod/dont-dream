title: Nothing I canâ€™t handle
---

Whenever you improvise a weapon, an explosive, a way in, or a way out, Roll + Body.

- On a 10+, you succeed.
- On a 7-9, you succeed, but something unexpected goes wrong - you hurt yourself, someone around you, or your chances. Choose one:
  - An investigator with you loses one health point.
  - A bond with a non-player character is sacrificed. That bond is removed from the game.
  - You lose one health point.
  - You take the disadvantage for the rest of the session.
