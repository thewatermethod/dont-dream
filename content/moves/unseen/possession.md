When you speak through the voice of the recently dead or spiritually connected (The Dreamer is especially susceptible to this), roll + POWER. On a hit, choose two. On a 10+, choose one.

- You communicate the presence of a clue. An investigator present can make a Gather Clues roll.
- Your will overwhelms the body. If it’s living, it loses one hit point. If it’s not, an investigator present loses one reality point.
- The investigator makes a reality check.
