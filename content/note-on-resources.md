There are many times in the game where you might be instructed as part of a roll to do one thing or another - for example, sacrifice a bond or sacrifice a reality point. These mechanics exist as fictional guardrails, but they should serve the fiction, not the other way around.

Although the core resources are not interchangeable, if it makes more sense to lose a health point than a reality point, the group should feel free to do what makes sense fictionally.

If you are called on to sacrifice a bond, the intention is (generally) that this is as a consequence of your actions. A good faith effort should be made to explain this in the fiction. Why does Clara the Veteran no longer have a bond with Mrs. Rush, the Librarian? If no explanation is easily found, it's important to remember that reality is malleable and it's very possible that Mrs. Rush never existed. Of course, a kindly old librarian disappearing is a great reason to make a reality check.

Like a low budget horror film, not everything has to hang together perfectly, but the experience will be more enjoyable for everyone if the attempt is made.
