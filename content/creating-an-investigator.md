- Choose a name and a [playbook](/playbooks).
- Choose one ability score to be at 2, one ability score to be at 1 and another to be -1. The others start at +0.
- Spend your bond points. You start with three. Assign one bond to a character in town and one to another Player Character.
- Choose a vice and whether that vice is driven by reality or health.

Do not spend a lot of time on your investigator's backstory. The idea is to reveal it in pieces using [The Backstory Move](/downtime-moves). However, it can be helpful to have the broad strokes of your investigators's backstory and personality in mind upon creation.
