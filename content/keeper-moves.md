## Keeper responsibilities

The Keeper is responsible for running each session. This means that they introduce the mystery, portray the non-player characters, move the game through the phases. It also generally falls on them to keep track of the Coffin's Mill and it's inhabitants.

They are also in charge of writing the history, agenda, and character of the Cabal, the sinister group of town elders whose eldritch machinations have brought the horrors to bear on Coffin's Mill.

This might seem like a lot, but it's entirely doable, and . Keep in mind, while the Keeper are responsible for keeping track of these things and portraying lots of characters, that does not mean the Keeper have to do it all themselves. The Keeper should feel free to enlist investigators to play NPCS, suggest cabal clues, create a certain area of the town, or keep track of NPCs. This is a collaborative experience, and it's everyone's responsibility to make sure fun is had.

There no fixed solutions to _Don't Dream_ mysteries, so that means there is no reason to stick religiously to the guidance in the mysteries. The play materials are meant to help and inspire, not to lock the Keeper or anyone else into doing anything one particular way.
