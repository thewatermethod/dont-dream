Each mysery the investigators confront will have a selection of questions and dangers that they must confront to put it to bed. The meat of the game is gathering clues towards the resolution of these questions.

## Putting the Pieces Together

When the investigators have an open discussion about the mystery, and they've earned clues equal to twice mystery's difficulty, the Keeper should prompt them with this move.

Unlike the other rolls and mechanics of this game, it is resolved as a group and should be approached almost like a negotiation.

Once the investigators have decided on an answer to the mystery's core question ("where is the killer?," for example) they need to build their pool of points.

### Building the pool

- Each investigator starts with 2d6.
- Add 1d6 for each clue they've gathered
- They may wager one bond to add an additional 2d6 to their pool. To wager a bond, subtract a bond quality point

### The roll

Each investigator than rolls their pool. Every die equal to or over the mystery's difficulty is a success.
Then, starting with the investigator who discovered the most clues, the mystery's puzzle pieces are purchased by spending those successes.

Most mysteries will have items in **bold** that must be chosen first. They can be chosen in any order. The rotation continues until a player has run out of clues. At that point, all remaining clues are lost.

For example, the pieces for "[Sleepover Murder Party](/adventures/sleepover-murder-party)", the introductory adventure in this book are reproduced below.

| Cost | Piece (bold must be chosen first)               |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [2]  | **All investigators survive the investigation** |
| [1]  | **The identity of the murderer is discovered**  |
| [1]  | **Where can the murderer be found?**            |
| [1]  | Your investigator does not lose 1 HP            |
| [1]  | Your investigator does not lose 1 RP            |
| [1]  | Your wagered bond survives                      |
| [1]  | The murderer is captured or killed              |
| [1]  | You uncover an additional magic item            |
| [1]  | Unlock a cabal clue                             |

In the above example, **all investigators survive the investigation**, **the identity of the murderer is discovered**, and **where can the murderer be found?** must be chosen before any of the other three. If all the players have excess successes after unlocking all the pieces for a given mystery, they may continue to go around the table restoring reality, health, or bond quality points until one player has no successes left.
