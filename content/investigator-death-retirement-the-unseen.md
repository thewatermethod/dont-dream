The rules to Don’t Dream are written in such a way that it is usually possible to avoid investigator death to a degree, but the rules do differ from other storytelling games that use similar rules in that investigator death can happen unexpectedly and there is a certain amount of lethality built into every mystery.

When an investigator dies or is rendered hopelessly unmoored from reality by all that they’ve experienced, time and space should be provided for that player, with the help of the Keeper if needed, to narrate a short scene or an epilogue for their investigator.

At this point, there are one of two options - the game has a built-in way to keep playing with the same investigator, and that is the Unseen playbook. A player may have their investigator return as a ghost. They keep their attributes but lose access to magical items and moves, and choose two moves from the Unseen playbook as if they were making a new investigator.

If an Unseen character dies, that should be considered final for the investigator.

Unseen characters can no longer affect the physical world, and if all investigators are unseen, they can no longer solve mysteries. Using the Unseen playbook should be considered optional and certain groups may not want the complication it provides.

Special consideration should also be given to the Two-in-One. If one of the two dies, it's a prime opportunity for the living half of the pair to choose a new playbooks.
