Abilities are the attributes that are applied to most die rolls in the game. They each have a modifier from -3 to +3. The abilities are: Body, Composure, Library Use, Force of Will, Affect, and Power.

## Body

An investigator rolls with BODY if the action involves a contest of strength, a feat of athleticism, or a particularly dextrous or physically challenging maneuver.

## Composure

An investigator rolls with COMPOSURE if they are trying to do something that requires intense concentration, a steady hand, or nerves of steel

## Library Use

An investigator rolls with LIBRARY USE if they are looking to do research in a book or computer, analyze some evidence, or turn up an unlikely fact.

## Affect

An investigator rolls AFFECT if they are trying to charm, intimidate, or entertain.

## Power

An investigator rolls POWER if the action involves using or understanding supernatural forces or the occult. A keeper can always override the use of any other ability to call for a power roll instead.
