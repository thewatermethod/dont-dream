_Dead or cursed, you move about the world imperceivable_

**Note:** The Unseen has several special conditions & rules for play. The Unseen is an optional playbook and you may not want to include it in your game if you’ve never played Don’t Dream before.

The following is true for the unseen

- The Unseen has 0 HP. If the Unseen would lose HP, they lose bonds (not bond quality points) instead.
- The Unseen has bonds with their past life. They start with 3 bonds that represent 3 of the most important memories that tie them to this existence. These bonds must be with a place or object that still exists.
- The Unseen cannot receive magical items
- The Unseen cannot communicate directly to the other investigators through speech. The Unseen cannot be perceived by any other characters, except by the Emissary.
- The Unseen can uncover clues but can’t communicate them to the party except with successful rolls on applicable moves.
- All Unseen have only one downtime move, Retrace. Each Unseen chooses this move automatically, and then two playbook moves as normal.
