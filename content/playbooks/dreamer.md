title: The Dreamer
---

_A tortured artist, psychic, and psychonaut_

As long as you remember, the dreams have been present. When you were a child, they were often dreams of the long, tall man, the man whose face you couldnâ€™t quite make out. Now, they reflect the ugliness of reality. The dreams used to be a blessing - now they are more like a curse.

**Describe and name the once-whimsical recurring character from your childhood that haunts your dreams in a newly nightmarish way.**
