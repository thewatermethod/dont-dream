Difficulty 4
_(8 clues to solve)_

The investigators decide to unwind with a night of fun at the arcade. Little do they know - there is something inside of the machines.

## Setting the Scene

- **First blood**: There's a particularly gnarly old machine in the corner - a game called _Knight Slayer_. Pick another investigator and describe the unnerving thing they hear the computerized voice call out as they walk by. No one else hears it.

## The murder

After a bit of socializing, the lights flicker, and the sound of a scream fills the air, followed by the smell of cooked turkey. Local _Big Belly Bustin'_ high score champion Kyle Mitchell is electrocuted, and just as he was about to beat his previous score.

## Locations

### Arcade downstairs

Brightly lit. Lots of claw machines. Ticket exchange booth. Candy everywhere. The focus down here is on loud machines that are trying to get your attention and quarters.

Set the scene: What's the arcade mascot?

### Arcade upstairs

Dark rugs, dim lights, everything smells like popcorn. Games up here are more likely to resemble Atari classics or have gimmicky controls where you pretend you're a submarine.

Set the scene: Describe a game.

### Snack bar

Terrible pizza. Depowered animatronic band. Free refills.

- Set the scene: What body part is the lead animatronic missing?

### The basement workshop

It's wet down here, which makes it a strange place to store a bunch of electronics.

- Set the scene: What's been living down here?

## Characters

- "Doomwizard": local edgelord, studier of the blade. Favors the Brujah in V:tM
- Angela Dawn: despite the black eyeliner, fishnets, and dark clothes, she's got a sunny disposition and is a real people pleaser. (only if she survived _[Party at the Witch House](/adventures/party-at-the-witch-house)_)
- William Ashlington, Angela's jockish boyfriend (only if he survived _[Party at the Witch House](/adventures/party-at-the-witch-house)_)
