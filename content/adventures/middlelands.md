Difficulty 5
_(10 clues to solve)_

_One or more of the investigators is exploring the sandy shores of the ponds near Coffin's Mill. They sense that they are being followed. If they turn, they see a strange creature - goatish and wearing a canvas mask over its head. It darts away._

_Later, a body is found in the pond. The throat has been chewed away. Police identify it as retired psychologist Cameron Miles._

## Setting the Scene

- **First blood**: An investigator ran into Cameron Miles earlier that day. Miles was a pleasant man, given to muttering to himself. He had blood on his collar, and the investigator commented on it. What excuse did Miles give?
- What strange weapon was found on Miles's body?

## The Killing

Forensics identify the bite marks as human.

Some clues can be gathered from the body itself

### Clues from the body

- Canvas threads
- A long slender paring knife, incredibly sharp
- A list of addresses all in neighboring towns. The addresses are all in a radius of about 50 miles. Investigating the people at the addresses yields nothing in particular. The only thing these folks have in common is the family configuration (1 man, 1 woman, 1 boy, 1 girl).

## Locations

### The kitchen

The kitchen is dark and dated. Dianne Cordon still cooked on an antique stove and used an ice box. It reeks of potpourri and smoked fish

Paint the scene: What was left cooking on the stove?

### The bathroom

The antique soaker tub is filled with ice cold water. There are flower petals scattered over the floor. The room is lit entirely by candles.

Paint the scene: You didn’t know Ms. Cordon had a pet. What evidence do you find in here that she did?

### The study

The study is lined with floor to ceiling bookshelves. There is a television in the corner. The floor is covered in a dark colored rug. With the curtains drawn, it’s nearly pitch black in here.

Paint the scene: Ms. Cordon was a great collector of world ephemera. What unexpected items do you find in her study?

### The bedroom

The bedroom has an antique four-poster bed. It is another dark room with heavy curtains and little light, and is packed with junk, bric-a-brac, and genuine valuables.

Paint the scene: Describe the painting of Ms. Cordon’s dead husband that hangs on the wall opposite her bed.

### The work shed

The work shed is full of ancient tools and gardening equipment. The investigator or investigators who have been helping Ms. Cordon are at least vaguely familiar with this.

Paint the scene: There is a strange antique tool that looks like it can perform murderous amounts of damage on a human body. It has trace amounts of blood on it. Describe the tool.

## Magical Items

- The investigator with the smallest grip reality is rewarded: a box that has what appears to be a large bird egg inside of it. Immediately and then once per session, as long as the egg remains in their possession, that investigator should make a reality check. The first time they fail, they come to the realization that the egg needs human blood splattered on it. Splattering the blood fills the investigator with incredibly positive feelings. Mark a bond with the egg. The egg loses a quality point each session it is not fed blood as a downtime action. If the player does feed the egg blood, they gain the advantage to all day and night rolls for that session. If the egg has no quality points or is sacrificed, the investigator is permanently plagued by bleak nightmares of being born into a prehistoric nightmare. Every time the investigator sleeps, they must make a reality check.

- A collection of rare teas. These can be consumed for 1 HP a total of three times.

- The investigator who earned the most clues during this mystery is rewarded with: The diary of Dianne Cordon. It’s a travelog of her journeys as a young woman. Once per session, an investigator can narrate or describe a passage from the journal and roll + LIBRARY USE. On a success, they take the advantage to their next gather clues roll. On a 12+, they also unlock a cabal clue.
