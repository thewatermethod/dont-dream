title: The Middlelands
---

Difficulty 5
_(10 clues to solve)_

_One or more of the investigators is exploring the sandy shores of the ponds near Coffin's Mill. They sense that they are being followed. If they turn, they see a strange creature - goatish and wearing a canvas mask over its head. It darts away._

_Later, a body is found in the pond. The throat has been chewed away. Police identify it as psychologist Cameron Miles._

## Setting the Scene

- **First blood**: An investigator ran into Cameron Miles earlier that day. Miles was a pleasant man, given to muttering to himself. He had blood on his collar, and the investigator commented on it. What excuse did Miles give?

## The Killing

Forensics identify the bite marks as human.
Some clues can be gathered from the body itself.

### Clues from the body

- Canvas threads
- A long slender paring knife, incredibly sharp
- A list of addresses all in neighboring towns. The addresses are all in a radius of about 50 miles. Investigating the people at the addresses yields nothing in particular. The only thing these folks have in common is the family configuration (1 man, 1 woman, 1 boy, 1 girl).
- (Cabal clue) A face mask, made of human skin, is lodged deep in the Cameron Miles's throat

## Locations

### The crime scene

The body is found on the shore of the town's recreational pond. The beach has been cordoned off by police.

Paint the scene: there is a patch of discolored sand near the shore, about a hundred feet from where the body was found. What color is it and what is causing the discoloration?

### The office of Cameron Miles

Miles's office is in the heart of the Coffin Mill downtown. It's a modern space, gleaming with chrome and glass, nestled into a block of brick buildings. His apartment is above.

Paint the scene: Miles's desk is locked. The lock is cast in black iron in a highly decorative and stylized shape, which looks old-fashioned and out of place in this space. What is the shape?

### The home of Cameron Miles

Miles's home is devoid of any distinguishing characteristics. Impeccably clean. Beige carpet. Empty bookshelves & walls.

Paint the scene: The sole decoration is a crudely made statue on a shelf. Describe it.

### The Middlelands

The Middlelands are a liminal space, occupied by the not-quite-human and the perpetual underclass of our world. You access them through the sewers of Coffin's Mill
