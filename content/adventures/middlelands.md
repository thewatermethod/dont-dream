Difficulty 5
_(10 clues to solve)_

_One or more of the investigators is exploring the sandy shores of the ponds near Coffin's Mill. They sense that they are being followed. If they turn, they see a strange creature - goatish and wearing a canvas mask over its head. It darts away._

_Later, a body is found in the pond. The throat has been chewed away. Police identify it as retired psychologist Cameron Miles._

## Setting the Scene

- **First blood**: An investigator ran into Cameron Miles earlier that day. Miles was a pleasant man, given to muttering to himself. He had blood on his collar, and the investigator commented on it. What excuse did Miles give?
- What strange weapon was found on Miles's body?

## The Killing

Forensics identify the bite marks as human.
Some clues can be gathered from the body itself.

### Clues from the body

- Canvas threads
- A long slender paring knife, incredibly sharp
- A list of addresses all in neighboring towns. The addresses are all in a radius of about 50 miles. Investigating the people at the addresses yields nothing in particular. The only thing these folks have in common is the family configuration (1 man, 1 woman, 1 boy, 1 girl).
