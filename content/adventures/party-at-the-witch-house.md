Difficulty 4
_(8 clues to solve)_

## Setting the Scene

- **First blood**: You get invited to a Halloween party by Angela Dawn at an old house in town. What was the house before it was shut down in the 1940's, and why is it now called "The Witch House"?

- (Everyone) Who's at the party?

## The murder

Roll for or pick one of the characters an investigator introduced. They turn up stuffed into the refridgerator. That character should probably make a reality roll.

Anyone who tries to leave the Witch House finds the wall surrounding the property, which once had a prominent gate, is now impassable. Discovering this, of course, triggers a Reality check.

## Locations

### The Grounds

The grounds are surrounded by a fifteen foot stone wall. One side, inexplicably, has barbed wire at the top. A few scraggly elms and maples mar the unhealthly lawn.

- Set the scene: what have you heard about the several old wheelchairs piled up in the Northeast corner of the wall?

### The Living Room

This is where the action is. The sound system is bumping. There's food. Most importantly, there's a keg that's been freshly tapped.

- Set the scene: What's playing?

### The Basement

The basement has a large, charnel furnace. It looks like it hasn't been turned on in a long time.

- Set the scene: What's been living down here?

## Characters

- Angela Dawn: despite the black eyeliner, fishnets, and dark clothes, she's got a sunny disposition and is a real people pleaser.
- William Ashlington, Angela's jockish boyfriend
- Crunch McHenry, their even more jockish friend
- Cindy & Silas Green, twins who love to party

## Magical Item

Once per session, if you don't like a roll you've just made, you can draw a tarot card from the deck. Roll a d10.

| Roll | Result       | Effect                                                                                         |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2  | Wands        | If you would lose a health or a reality point from this roll, instead you lose one less        |
| 3-4  | Coins        | Add +1 to your roll.                                                                           |
| 5-6  | Swords       | Add +2 to your roll If you would lose a health or reality point, instead you lose one more.    |
| 7-8  | Cups         | Move your roll up one success tier (A 6 becomes a 7, a 7 becomes a 10, etc)                    |
| 9-10 | Major Arcana | You may re-roll the roll you didn't like. Roll on the major arcana table to see what you drew. |
