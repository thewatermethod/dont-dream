Paint the scene: You didn’t know Ms. Cordon had a pet. What evidence do you find in here that she did?

Paint the scene: Ms. Cordon was a great collector of world ephemera. What unexpected items do you find in her study?

Paint the scene: Describe the painting of Ms. Cordon’s dead husband that hangs on the wall opposite her bed.

### The work shed

## Magical Items

- The investigator with the smallest grip reality is rewarded: a box that has what appears to be a large bird egg inside of it. Immediately and then once per session, as long as the egg remains in their possession, that investigator should make a reality check. The first time they fail, they come to the realization that the egg needs human blood splattered on it. Splattering the blood fills the investigator with incredibly positive feelings. Mark a bond with the egg. The egg loses a quality point each session it is not fed blood as a downtime action. If the player does feed the egg blood, they gain the advantage to all day and night rolls for that session. If the egg has no quality points or is sacrificed, the investigator is permanently plagued by bleak nightmares of being born into a prehistoric nightmare. Every time the investigator sleeps, they must make a reality check.

- A collection of rare teas. These can be consumed for 1 HP a total of three times.

- The investigator who earned the most clues during this mystery is rewarded with: The diary of Dianne Cordon. It’s a travelog of her journeys as a young woman. Once per session, an investigator can narrate or describe a passage from the journal and roll + LIBRARY USE. On a success, they take the advantage to their next gather clues roll. On a 12+, they also unlock a cabal clue.
