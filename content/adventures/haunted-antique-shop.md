Difficulty 3
_(6 clues to solve)_

## Establishing questions

- **First blood**: There is a new antique shop in town, a shop named Forgotten Desires that feels as though it has always been there. What do you see in the window that you both dearly miss and haven’t seen since childhood? Make a reality check and record whether it was a pass or failure.
- Who is emerging from the shop looking furtive and clearly hiding something under his coat?
- What is the name (or names) of the proprietors of the antique shop, and why do they immediately strike you as untrustworthy?

## The Killing

Frame a scene late that night. If the player who answered the First Blood question failed their reality check, they have an intense dream about the item in the window and wake up obsessed with having it.

The day after the characters pass through and see the antique shop for the first time, they get word that the person who emerged from the shop looking furtive has been killed. The player who describes them makes a reality check.

## Locations

### Forgotten Desires

The shop is packed to the gills with ephemera, Americana, and general junk from the last 200 years. Still, there are treasures here, priced at seemingly a fraction of their total worth.

Paint the scene: Describe something incredibly rare and presumably valuable that is sitting at the bottom of a bin with a $1 price tag.

### The home of the victim

The home of the victim is a normal suburban home in most ways, except for the unwrapped plain brown paper package on the table. It’s a chipped, ordinary Victorian era doll.

Paint the scene: What is the doll’s name?

### Father Masterson’s residence

The priest of the town’s main Catholic Church reports that someone has slashed his tires! His home is a small cottage attached to the church, and is mainly a home for his books and study of theology and the classics.

Paint the scene: What occult item sits on Masterson’s overcrowded desk?

## Characters

- The proprietors of Forgotten Desires are created in establishing questions, but they are by default a friendly middle aged couple, probably a pair of classic hippies-turned-Chamber of Commerce members. Think sandals with socks, ponytails, worn Brooks Brothers polos.

- Father Masterson, resident priest, who swears that pranks have been plaguing his church in greater and greater frequency, and getting less and less funny, since the shop opened. If Masterson survives, he may be of further use as a recurring character to the investigators, since he has a background in the occult and once served as an exorcist.

- July Mirthwell, disaffected resident, has a substance abuse problem. She’s been at Forgotten Desires nearly every day.

- Jon “King” Caesar, the owner of the local car dealership. A medium fish in a small pond, he thinks he’s entitled to everything he sees. A former athlete, still does his best to keep in shape, but a sizeable level of tailgating has left him with a small but growing paunch.

## Clues & Evocations

- A secret room at the back of Forbidden Desires, seemingly very old, with mud walls and a single desk with an ankle chain on the floor

- (Cabal clue) A scrapbook packed with vintage newspaper articles describing goings-on at Coffin’s Mill (the actual sawmill, not the town named for it)
- (Cabal clue) A print of the supposedly haunted adaptation of The Turmoil, filmed in Coffin’s Mill

## Magical Items

The investigator with the least reality is rewarded: A handwritten copy of Kitab al-Azif, an ancient Arabic grimoire. As long as the book is in their possession, that investigator gets the following move:

#### Consult the Void

_When you are faced with something you can’t explain, Roll + LIBRARY USE or REALITY.
On any hit, describe the dark god who gives you a grim omen from beyond that grants you a clue. On a 7-9, describe the person from your past whose face that god wears and make a reality check. On a miss, the dark god lies. Lose 1 reality._

The investigator who earned the most clues is awarded: An ornate silver whistle with the phrase **quis est iste qui venit** carved into the side. As long as the whistle is in their possession, they take +1 to POWER. If they lose or break the whistle, they make the following move.

#### Pursued from Beyond

_When you lose or break the mysterious whistle, roll + POWER.
On any hit, you are safe. On a 10+, the whistle appears again when and where you least expect it. On a miss, inform the keeper that you are being pursued by a being from deep time. They should use this in a hard move the next time you roll a miss or give them a golden opportunity._

Everyone receives: A bottle of vintage Amontillado. As a downtime move, a player may drink a glass of Amontillado. Roll + HP. On a hit, that player may restore one health point. On a 9 or below, that player has the intense feeling of claustrophobia and must make a reality check. Good for 3 usages.
