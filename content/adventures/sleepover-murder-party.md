title: "Sleepover Murder Party"
---

Difficulty: 3
_(6 clues to solve)_

**_An Introductory Mystery_**

_The town is awash with news of a terrible tragedy. A slumber party with three teenage girls was attacked by a masked man wielding an ax. There was one survivor, a girl named Clarice Stephens. She is recuperating at a nearby hospital. The police (and everyone else in town) are launching a manhunt through the woods that surround Coffin’s Mill._

_The investigators sit in a diner in town (how’s the food?) when one of the younger police officers comes in to gather volunteers to canvas the woods. People shake their heads in misery at the news - there’s been a series of murders at the Stephens’._

## Setting the Scene

- **First blood**: One of you (or a group of you) encounters a tall, gaunt man somewhere in town. He’s shambling and refusing to make eye contact. Where was it? Did you speak to him? Why don’t you get a good look at his face?
- How was Clarice Stephens kind to you when you first arrived in town?

## The Killing

Described by Claire as a tall man wearing “a full leather body suit”, “Elvis hair”, and carrying “an ax like a knight uses.” He killed two teenage girls, Lauren Quinlan and Cassandra Santos, a rookie police officer named Milo Jones, and a pizza delivery girl named Rita Brown.

## The Questions

- Who is the killer?
- Where can you find them?

## Locations

### The Stephens House

A well-kept, large suburban home
Paint the scene: What is the unlikely piece of art that hangs in the Stephens’ living room?

### The Woods

The police force are searching the woods outside of Coffin Hill for the killer and evidence thereof.

Paint the scene: What plant or animal is present in the woods completely out of season?

## Characters

- Mr & Mrs Stephens, the owners of the house where the murder happens and the parents of the survivor, Clarice. They wear the dull smiles of the people pleaser. They are clearly grieving over their daughter, and yet they are distastefully worried about exposure from the other families.
- Chief Toomes, the town’s overworked police chief. Wears a walrus mustache and indulges a bit too much in dressing like a cowboy for someone in coastal New England
- Viera Santos, the older sister and guardian of Cassandra Santos, a nurse who clearly does not care for the Stephens
- Tim “Timbo” Johnson, the owner of Timbo’s Slices. An older man with a perpetually stained shirt and the body of someone who eats pizza for dinner every night, he is deeply upset about the murder of Rita Brown, whom he calls “his best delivery girl.”
- Dr. Regina Clarence, a psychiatrist who was treating Mrs Stephens for many years. She is a bit of an odd duck, favoring loud hawaiian clothing and prone to conspiratorial rants.

## Clues & Evocations

- In the Stephens house, there is a bag of stuffed animals sitting by the door, as if they were just packed up to be taken outside.
- An abandoned telephone repair truck. It seems to have a great deal more hardware than it needs to.
- A mental patient confined for involvement in an occult ritual that killed a young girl in the late 1960’s has recently escaped nearby.
- Half of the record collection in the Stephens house have gone missing.
- A partially burnt scrap of paper found in the fireplace with a coded message that reads "I wanted you."
- A camp in the woods, recently abandoned
- The Kiss of Aquarius, an infamous true crime book about sixties cult murders with the cover ripped off
- A stack of magazines, some Renaissance Faire themed magazines, many others pornographic
- (Cabal clue) The wall inside the Stephens garage is crawling with thousands of snails.
- (Cabal clue) Stone in the woods are arranged in a meaningful pattern
- (Cabal clue) A casio keyboard that plays weirdly detuned sounds that sound like human language
- (Cabal clue) A notebook with a heart drawn on it and an arrow through it. Inside the heart is written “The Nightmaster” but it disappears as soon as any other investigator or character besides the investigator who found it looks at it.

## Magical Items

- The investigator with the least reality is awarded: A record of novelty songs, recorded locally in the late 1960’s. Listening to this record backwards can induce a trance. Once per session, an investigator can play the record and detail a vision of the other side. Make a reality check. This insight gives them the advantage to the next Gather Clues roll that they make.

- The investigator who discovered the most clues is awarded: The murderer’s axe, which awards +1 to any rolls when used in dangerous circumstances.
