## Downtime

Each investigator may make a downtime move (or more, depending on XP). See Downtime moves for more information.

## First Blood

The Keeper introduces a new mystery. Investigators may investigate up to 2 mysteries at a time.

The investigator with the least reality points (using bond quality points as a tiebreaker) will answer the mystery’s first blood questions and together, the investigators and the Keeper help set the scene.

After the scene is set and the first blood questions are answered, the Keeper should feel free to share the specific problems the investigators are trying to solve (the "pieces" of the mystery).

## Investigation & Exploration

During the investigation scene, each investigator will have a chance to investigate the murder and uncover the town’s dark secrets. Proceed around the table so that each investigator has a turn in the spotlight. The investigation phase continues unless the investigators are ready to put the pieces together. Investigators may also choose to investigate the town of Coffin's Mill and form bonds with the inhabitants.

## Putting the Pieces Together

This is triggered by a freeform discussion about a mystery where the investigators have gathered clues equal to twice the mystery's difficulty. This move has it's own procedures, which are detailed in [Putting the Pieces Together](/putting-the-pieces-together).

## Gather What’s Left

There should be a short epilogue where funerals are attended, hospitals are visited, and loose ends from the mystery are wrapped up. This is a freeform phase and a chance for general roleplaying. This is where magical items are given out, via flashbacks or any other appropriate storytelling mechanism.

A note about magical items: the mysteries in this book often specify that the “investigator who gathered the most clues” and the “investigator with the least reality points” are to receive magical items. In the (common) case that these are the same character, the items should not be given to the same investigator but resolved in a top down order based on how they are presented in the mystery.

Some mysteries stipulate that a wagered bond can die if the clue cost to save them is not paid - others simply read "sacrifice." **Gather What's Left** is also when to explain in the fiction the absence of any bonds that were sacrificed. There is no one way for a bond to be sacrificed, so be creative. They may vanish from the face of the earth, replaced by a new character, they may die gruesomely, or they may simply not recognize an investigator.
