## Unlocked after the fact

- (Cabal) Jedediah (Cabal) 1977 / A group of teenagers playing a role-playing game cause a panic in the town when one of them, 16 year old Laura Marnoli, is immolated in a basement.

One remains alive, and when pressed, he canâ€™t help but rave incoherently about a demon named Moloch who they summoned accidentally.
