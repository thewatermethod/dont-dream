Most of the actions the investigators will take are in service of the gathering of clues. Clues are the corest of the core resources in Donâ€™t Dream. The Keeper should give out clues liberally and work with the investigators to make sure that every opportunity to gather a clue is taken. Clues are gathered through the [Gather Clues](/moves-everyone-has) move and spent during the [Putting the Pieces Together](/putting-the-pieces-together) move.

There are two types of Clue. **Core** clues, which are clues to the mystery the investigators are actively investigating, and **Cabal** clues. A Cabal clue is earned through specific die rolls and playbooks and is a clue related to the dark conspiracy at the core of Coffin's Mill. Each mystery will have sample Cabal clues.
