_Times are tough in **Coffin's Mill**. They say this place is cursed._

_You’ve landed here for your own reasons. A group of outsiders, each with secrets of your own. Somehow it’s fallen to you to investigate the killings that haunt this place._

_What you never imagined is that in Coffin's Mill there are crimes worse than murder, and fates much worse than death._

## The Game

Don’t Dream is a tabletop role playing game about the forces of darkness and exploitation at work in a small town. Its aim is to produce collaborative storytelling sessions that explore mystery, horror, and surrealism through the lens of the tongue-in-cheek world of 1980’s horror films.

The principles of the game are:

- Don't Dream works best with at least 3 players and as many six sided dice as you can find.
- One of those players takes the role of the the **Keeper** of Arcane Lore and is responsible for certain parts of the story, including the world at large as well as making rules decisions when called upon and keeping action flowing where appropriate.
- The other players take the role of **investigators**, that is, they are portraying newly arrived characters in Coffin's Mill. They will create characters, roll dice, and help build the world.
- _Play to find out_. The story is found at the table through interaction and dice rolling, not planned out beforehand by the Keeper.
- Although investigators are solving mysteries and battling evil, there are no set solutions to the individual mysteries. It is the Keeper’s job to lay down puzzling, mysterious, upsetting, or surreal imagery and events. It is the player’s job to explain them.
- To do something, _do it_. The moves are triggers for when to roll and how to handle resolution and push the fiction forwards.
- Investigators are fragile. Unlike some other story games, an investigator in _Don't Dream_ can die or fade from reality unexpectedly.

<div class="callout-box">
Don’t Dream is is heavily inspired by (and borrows from) rules and mechanics found in the games The Between and Brindlewood Bay, both written by Jason Cordova and published by the Gauntlet. Those games in turn are Powered by the Apocalypse, which means that they use rules and mechanics created by Vincent and Meguey Baker and first published in the game Apocalypse World. It departs mechanically and philosophically from those games in several key ways.

## Rolling Dice

_Don't Dream_ resolves uncertain outcomes and moves the story forward when investigators trigger moves. Some moves every investigator has; others are specific to an investigator's playbook. (There will be more on playbooks later, but a playbook represents a character archetype pulled from the fiction that inspired _Don't Dream_.)

For the majority of moves, an invesigator rolls six-sided dice, sum them, and then add the modifier from the [relevant ability](/abilities).The result is then checked against the text of the move.

If a move refers to a “hit,” it means a result of 7+.

If a move refers to a “miss,” it means a result of 6-.

Moves also frequently have success tiers: a miss, 7-9, 10-11, and, rarely, 12+.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When rolling with advantage, roll three dice, keep the two highest, sum them, and then add the modifier of the relevant ability.

When rolling at a disadvantage, roll three dice, keep the two lowest, sum them, and then add the modifier of the relevant ability.

### Resolving mysteries

A key way that _Don't Dream_ differs from more traditional mystery solving and occult investigation games is that there are no fixed solutions to the mysteries.

Instead of providing a story with a fixed solution, the Keeper provides **atmosphere** and **arbitrates** the rules, while building the surreal world of Coffin's Mill in cooperation with the investigators.

The investigators are responsible for weaving the clues they find into a cohesive explanation. They should not expect a perfect solution.

Each individual mystery is resolved via game procedure called [Putting the Pieces Together](/putting-the-pieces-together).
