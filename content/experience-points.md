Experience points in _Don't Dream_ are unlike experience points in other games. Whereas in other games, experience points (XP) can be used to make a character more powerful, in _Don't Dream_ they provide various levels of utility.

Investigators earn an experience point in the following ways:

- Roll a 6 or less on any move, excluding Putting the Pieces together or Downtime moves.
- Narrate or participate in a moment that the Keeper finds particularly inspired

Keepers are also encouraged to aware XP for out-of-game "support" activities like:

- Scheduling sessions
- Hosting sessions
- Writing session recaps

Investigators can use XP to do the following at will:

- Spend 2 XP to add +1 to any dice roll
- Spend 3 XP to take an additional downtime action
