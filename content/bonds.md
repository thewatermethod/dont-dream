Bonds are another core resource in Don’t Dream. They represent relationships that an investigator has with a character in the town where the magic is happening. Like real life relationships, these bonds can offer important support to the investigators, but they need to be nurtured to be productive.

A bond has between 1 and 3 quality points. Some moves, situations, or consequences may cause the investigators to sacrifice these quality points in order to advance the plot. Investigators can spend time [improving these bonds](/downtime-moves) or [building new ones](/moves-everyone-has). Investigators may also be called upon to sacrifice a bond itself, most often during [Putting the Pieces Together](/putting-the-pieces-together). This means removing that bond from play. The investigator and the keeper will narrate a scene explaining how that character has left Coffin's Mill.

An investigator receives three bond points at character creation time. This represents the investigator’s main tie to the town that they live in when they first arrive.

An investigator can also form bonds with the other investigators. You can nurture this bond with the Backstory Move. You can sacrifice quality points from this bond but you cannot sacrifice the bond itself. If a move or rule would have you sacrifice this bond for some reason, you must instead sacrifice a health point or reality point.
