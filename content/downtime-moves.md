- On any hit, form a bond with that new character and mark one quality point in that bond.

## Elsewhere

You narrate a scene in town during which none of the player characters are present. The scene should be unsettling but not an actual murder. It may involve any player’s bonds or a new character or location within the town. It can be simply an evocative description, or a full narrative scene. Roll + POWER.
