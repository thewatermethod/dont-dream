## Reveal backstory

When you reveal something hidden about your past to another investigator, ROLL + your bond with that investigator.

- On a 10+, you and that investigator mark an additional bond or you each gain a reality point.
- On a 7-9, you or that investigator each gain a reality point.

## Touch grass

You indulge in meditation, exercise, or whatever healthy behavior works for you. It doesn't literally have to involve grass. Roll + BODY. On a 7-9, you gain an HP or an RP. On a 10+, you gain one of each.

## Resist alienation

You may choose to build your connections, tethering your investigator to reality. Describe an environment and nominate another player to create a character to inhabit it. Roll + AFFECT.

- On a 10+, you and that player each gain 1 XP
- On any hit, form a bond with that new character and mark one quality point in that bond.

## Elsewhere

You narrate a scene in town during which none of the player characters are present. The scene should be unsettling but not an actual murder. It may involve any playerâ€™s bonds or a new character or location within the town. It can be simply an evocative description, or a full narrative scene. Roll + POWER.

- On a 10+, you gain 3 XP.
- On a 7-9, you gain 2 XP.
