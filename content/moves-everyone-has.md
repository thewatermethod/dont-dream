## Form a Bond

_When you make an honest connection with a member of the community, name two details about this bond. Roll + AFFECT._

- On a 10+, you form a bond. Mark one quality point with your new bond.
- On a 7-9, you form a bond. Mark one quality point. Choose one: you make your new bond uneasy, or they make you uneasy.
- On a 12+, you may mark two quality points.

## Harm’s Way

_When you do something risky, describe the worst consequence you can imagine, then roll with an appropriate Ability._

- On a 10+, you do what you intended or you hold steady; describe what it looks like. You may add a bond, a health, or a reality point.
- On a 7-9, the Keeper will tell you how your actions would leave you vulnerable, and you can choose to back down or go through with it. If you go through with it, the Keeper describes what it looks like. If you do not, make a reality check.
- On a 12+, you do what you intended or you hold steady, and the Keeper will tell you some extra benefit or advantage you receive. Describe what it looks like.

The Keeper has final say on which ability is used for the roll.

## The Reality Check

_When your grip on reality is threatened or one of your bonds is reduced to 0 quality points, you Roll + COMPOSURE._

- On a 10+, you lose no reality points.
- On a 7-9, you lose 1 reality point.
- On a 6-, you lose 2 reality points.
- On a 12+, you gain 1 reality point

## Gather Clues

_When you search for a clue, conduct research, or otherwise gather information, describe how you’re doing so and roll with an appropriate ability. On a hit, you find a Clue or a magical item. The Keeper will tell you what it is._

- On a 7–9, there’s a complication—either with the Clue itself, or a complication you encounter while searching. The Keeper will tell you what the complication is.
- On a 12+, you also unlock a Cabal clue.

Clues are necessary for the Investigators to solve the mysteries and killings which haunt the town. As such, the Investigators will gather clues often, and the move should be triggered liberally. It encompasses a wide spate of possible investigative and information gathering activities. The player and the keeper should work together to determine which ability is used. If there is any dispute, the Keeper will decide.

## Back from the Brink

_If you would lose your last reality or health point, you may instead sacrifice a bond. If you do, roll + the points you invested in that bond._

- On a 10+, you may regain one point in that bond. You and the keeper will narrate a scene explaining how your search for the dark conspiracy pushed your relationship to the limit. You may unlock one Cabal clue.
- On a 7-9, you may unlock one Cabal clue. You and the keeper should explain how your relationship with that bond has unraveled.
