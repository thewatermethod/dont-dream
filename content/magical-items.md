Certain adventures unlock magical items. These magical items serve as the advancement mechanic for Don’t Dream, and can do things like increase stats, add new moves, or provide new resources of reality, bonds, or health.

They will often have rolls with specific consequences for failure. Some items are consumable, meaning they are used a certain number of times to enhance a stat or roll. Where noted, a magical item may be intended for use by a certain playbook or playbooks.

A mystery may specify that the “investigator who gathered the most clues” or the “investigator with the least reality” or other conditional situations are to receive specific magical items. In the (common) case that these are the same character, the items should not be given to the same investigator but resolved in a top down order based on how they are presented in the mystery.

For more information and context, see the sample mysteries.

## Creating magical items

Keepers should feel empowered to create their own magical items as well. Remember that a magical item should represent a character improvement, but remember the most interesting magical items create counterplay - they ask something of the player, introduce a complication, or have a subtle downside. The best are neither wholly good nor wholly bad.
