Certain adventures unlock magical items. These magical items serve as the advancement mechanic for Don’t Dream, and can do things like increase stats, add new moves, or provide new resources of reality, bonds, or health.

They will often have rolls with specific consequences for failure. Some items are consumable, meaning they are used a certain number of times to enhance a stat or roll. Where noted, a magical item may be intended for use by a certain playbook or playbooks.

A mystery may specify that the “investigator who gathered the most clues” or the “investigator with the least reality” or other conditional situations are to receive specific magical items. In the (common) case that these are the same character, the items should not be given to the same investigator but resolved in a top down order based on how they are presented in the mystery.

For more information and context, see the sample mysteries.

## Creating magical items

Keepers should feel empowered to create their own magical items as well. Remember that a magical item should represent a character improvement, but remember the most interesting magical items create counterplay - they ask something of the player, introduce a complication, or have a subtle downside. The best are neither wholly good nor wholly bad.

## Understanding a magical item

It's totally fine for a Keeper to share the rules, benefits, and drawbacks of a magical item with the investigators. However, a Keeper who wants to up the difficulty may optionally keep such information secret. If so, a POWER roll should be used to understand the nature of the item.

<div class="playbook-move bordered">

<h3>Erect the Citadel of Abbaxon</h3>

When you create the structure in the Citadel, describe the size you choose to build it at and roll + POWER. On a hit, you have summoned Abbaxon, who appears "to-scale" with his citadel. You may choose 1 boon from Abbaxon. On a 10+, choose 2. A miss means you have failed to construct the citadel, but you retain the move. You may re-roll this downtime move as _Contract with Abbaxon_.

</div>

<div>

</div>

</div>

<div>

_Instead of a Polaroid logo, it has a Seal of Solomon. Red woven strap, looks handmade_

This camera has film enough for one photograph in it. A picture of a living investigator makes them immune to physical damage. Any damage done to the investigator's HP is instead done to the photograph of the investigator.

Investigators should still keep track of HP - if the image is destroyed, all wounds are visited upon that investigator at once. If an investigator has gone well into negative HP and the picture is destroyed, they explode in a gory tableau.

Viewing the image after it shows damage requires a reality check. The investigator depicted on the picture takes double reality point loss.

<div class="playbook-move bordered">

<h3>Galatea</h3>

On a 10+, you create that image or an image of an imagined investigator, and you may take a move from any other playbook.

Either way, you gain a bond or a bond point with this figure. If you lose a bond point with the figure, you must also make a reality check.

</div>
